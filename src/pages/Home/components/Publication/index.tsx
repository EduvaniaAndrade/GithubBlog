          Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these
          often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to
          list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what
          properties they have These can be used to build other data structures.
          Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn. Dynamic
          typing JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables
          in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value
          type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all
          types: let foo = 42; // foo is now a number foo = 'bar'; // foo is now
          a string foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
